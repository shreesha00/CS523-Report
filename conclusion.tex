\section{Conclusion}

We have built and evaluated ImageHarbour, a distributed image caching system for applications such as Docker. ImageHarbour leverages a memory pool to cache frequently used Docker images and provides a low-latency image retrieval mechanism for client machines. Our evaluation results demonstrate that ImageHarbour performs on-par or better than existing image retrieval methods such as local disk, private registry, and Docker Hub in terms of latency, while efficiently utilizing the resources in the cluster.
