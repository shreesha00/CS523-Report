    In this paper, we present ImageHarbour, a novel image caching mechanism that leverages stranded memory \cite{reiss2012heterogeneity} from multiple hosts to create a large, unified memory pool in data centers \cite{gu2017efficient}. 
    By utilizing one-sided RDMA, which offers latencies in the sub-microsecond range \cite{kalia2016design} compared to 5-10 milliseconds for disk access \cite{yang2014don} and seconds to minutes for Docker pull over the internet \cite{harter2016slacker},
    ImageHarbour efficiently accesses memory on remote nodes without interrupting the CPU, enabling effective utilization of underutilized resources. 
    This approach can improve latency by up to 74x compared to traditional methods.
